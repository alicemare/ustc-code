1. 

   1. 256 for the reason that trap vector table begin with x00ff, and end with x0200

   2. because the value of PC before TRAP is stored in R7, BRnzp does not change PC use R7, which is not save

   3. three times: firstly, store PC in R7, secondly, load x23 into MAR and find the begin of serivce routinue, thirdly and lastly, load PC with R7

2. Stack is an ADT which can only be accessed in the way that the last thing stored in it is the first thing when remove from it.

   Two implementations:

   1. Only when we move away the above books can we access the last book
   2. A set of sits 

   difference: the order is the same but what the stack store is different.

3.  

   1. using 'I' stand of "Push" and 'O' stand of "Pop"

      | I/O  | Stack(after I/O) | Print     |
      | ---- | ---------------- | --------- |
      | I    | Z                | N.A       |
      | I+O  | Z                | Y         |
      | I+O  | Z                | YX        |
      | I    | ZW               | YX        |
      | I+O  | ZW               | YXV       |
      | I+O  | ZW               | YXVU      |
      | O    | Z                | YXVUW     |
      | O    | NULL             | YXVUWZ    |
      | I    | T                | TXVUWZ    |
      | I+O  | T                | TXVUWZS   |
      | I+O  | T                | TXVUWZSR  |
      | O    | NULL             | TXVUWZSRT |

   2. $2^4=16$

   4. POP

   ```assembly
   POP	LD  R2, EMPTY
   	ADD R3,R6,R2	;COMPARE STACK
   	BRz UNDERFLOW
   	LDR R0,R6,#0
   	ADD R6,R6,#1
   	LDR R1,R6,#0	;32bit STORE
   	ADD R6,R6,#1
   	RET
   EMPTY .FILL XC000
   ```

   PUSH

```assembly
PUSH LD  R1,EMPTY
	 ADD R3,R6,R1
	 BRZ FAILURE
	 LDR R0,R6,#0
	 ADD R6,R6,#1
	 LDR R1,R6,#0
	 ADD R6,R6,#1
	 AND R5,R5,#0
	 RET
FAILURE AND R5,R5,#0
		ADD R5,R5,#2
		RET
EMPTY .FILL XC000
```

5. using stack to output only EEsome char by char from .STRING

   part A. stroe trap service routine in R0,R1,R2 for the future using

   part B. output char 

   part C. initilization

6. assume the length of array is n 

   then the times lab A carried out is n-1

   ERROR:

   This trap handler doesn't deal with old PC R7, so when it comes to the RET, this handler won't return to a proper address.

   we can correct it as follow: add the below sentence

   > ADD R7,PC,#0

    

7. a.

| operation | oprand stack  | Memory  |
| --------- | ------------- | ------- |
| PUSH V    | v             | w x y z |
| PUSH W    | v w           | x y z   |
| PUSH X    | v w x         | y z     |
| PUSH Y    | v w x y       | z       |
| MUL       | v w x*y       | z       |
| ADD       | v w+x*y       | z       |
| PUSH Z    | v w+x*y z     |         |
| SUB       | v z-(w+x*y)   |         |
| DIV       | (z-(w+x*y))/v |         |
| POP U     |               | u       |

The minimum of memory unit needed is 4
